# CH32V00x-X-SSD1306 library guide
## Information 
This library is provided for MountRiver studio IDE. You can use it where and when even you want.  
The code has been developped for CH32V00x range that include :  
* CH32V002  
* CH32V003  
* CH32V006  
* CH32V007  

Please, if you use it, do not remove my credits.

## Install
In order to install this library, just put the source files into your MountRiver studio project.  
You can both put the headers ```( .h )``` and the sources ```( .c )``` into the "User" sub-directory.  

## Hardware specifications

You can find the datasheet there : https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf  

## Use 

In order to use this library, you have to include the header at the beginnig of the c file where you want to use it.  

/!\ Warning : The CH32V00x series ÂµC has only 1 I2C device.  
That's mean you have to connect your display on the PC1 ```( SDA )``` and PC2 screen ```( SCK )```.    

/!\ Warning : Most of the SSD1306 have the ```I2C``` address ```0x3C``` or ```0x3D```.  

### Documentation  

Have to be write 

## Tools 

In order to enhance my library's ergonomics, I made a python application that provide multiple solutions to make font and create image for the display. 

This application should be released in the same time as the version 1.2 of my library.  

You can find the [repo here](https://github.com/Ign555/SSD1306-convert-tool).
